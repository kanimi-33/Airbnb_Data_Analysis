This is an exploratory project to analyze publicly available London Airbnb data. 
In particular the analysis focuses on:
Identifying the most expensive Airbnb areas in London
Identifying price discrepancies within areas
Identifying amenities that are associated with high and low priced listings
Building a linear model used for data modeling to predict the advertised price
